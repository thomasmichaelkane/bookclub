[{"title": "Oliver Twist", "author": "Charles Dickens", "olid": "OL8193478W", "description": "Oliver Twist; or, The Parish Boy's Progress, is the second novel by English author Charles Dickens. It was originally published as a serial from 1837 to 1839, and as a three-volume book in 1838. The story follows the titular orphan, who, after being raised in a workhouse, escapes to London, where he meets a gang of juvenile pickpockets led by the elderly criminal Fagin, discovers the secrets of his parentage, and reconnects with his remaining family.\r\n\r\nOliver Twist unromantically portrays the sordid lives of criminals, and exposes the cruel treatment of the many orphans in London in the mid-19th century.[2] The alternative title, The Parish Boy's Progress, alludes to Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, as well as the 18th-century caricature series by painter William Hogarth, A Rake's Progress and A Harlot's Progress.\r\n\r\nIn an early example of the social novel, Dickens satirises child labour, domestic violence, the recruitment of children as criminals, and the presence of street children. The novel may have been inspired by the story of Robert Blincoe, an orphan whose account of working as a child labourer in a cotton mill was widely read in the 1830s. It is likely that Dickens's own experiences as a youth contributed as well, considering he spent two years of his life in the workhouse at the age of 12 and subsequently, missed out on some of his education.", "cover_url": "https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/13300802-L.jpg"}, {"title": "My life, and other stories [7 stories]", "author": "\u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d \u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0427\u0435\u0445\u043e\u0432", "olid": "OL55481W", "description": "Contains:\r\n[\u041c\u043e\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL9120843W)", "cover_url": "https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9558052-L.jpg"}, {"title": "Macbeth", "author": "William Shakespeare", "olid": "OL258902W", "description": "The play concerns a trusted general who secretly lusts for power.

A gripping, heart-wrenching, and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a South poisoned by virulent prejudice, it views a world of great beauty and savage inequities through the eyes of a young girl, as her father -- a crusading local lawyer -- risks everything to defend a black man unjustly accused of a terrible crime.\r\n\r\nLawyer Atticus Finch defends Tom Robinson -- a black man charged with the rape of a white girl.

The era of Catherine the Great (1762\u20131796), when the royal court in Paris was the centre of western European civilization,[16] is still fresh in the minds of older people. Catherine, fluent in French and wishing to reshape Russia into a great European nation, made French the language of her royal court. For the next one hundred years, it became a social requirement for members of the Russian nobility to speak French and understand French culture.[16] This historical and cultural context in the aristocracy is reflected in War and Peace. Catherine's grandson, Alexander I, came to the throne in 1801 at the age of 24.

Sethe works at \"beating back the past,\" but it is alive in all of them. It keeps Denver fearful of straying from the house. It fuels the sadness that has settled into Baby Suggs' \"desolated center where the self that was no self made its home.\" And to Sethe, the past makes itself heard and felt incessantly: in memories that both haunt and soothe her...in the arrival of Paul D (\"There was something blessed in his manner. Women saw him and wanted to weep\"), one of her fellow slaves on the farm where she had once been kept...in the vivid and painfully cathartic stories she and Paul D tell each other of their years in captivity, of their glimpses of freedom...and, most powerfully, in the apparition of Beloved, whose eyes are expressionless at their deepest point, whose doomed childhood belongs to the hideous logic of slavery and who, as daughter, sister and seductress, has now come from the \"place over there\" to claim retribution for what she lost and for what was taken from her. Sethe's struggle to keep Beloved from gaining full possession of her present--and to throw off the long, dark legacy of her past--is at the center of this profoundly affecting and startling novel. But its intensity and resonance of feeling, and the boldness of its narrative, lift it beyond its particulars so that it speaks to our experience as an entire nation with a past of both abominable and ennobling circumstance.

From this plot emerged some of Steinbeck\u2019s most fascinating characters \u2013 many of whom are modeled after people in his own life.\r\n\r\nPart allegory, part autobiography, and part epic, East of Eden was an ambitious project from the start \u2013 a gift to Steinbeck\u2019s sons that was meant to teach them about identity, grief, and what it means to be human. Tinged with biblical echoes of the fall of Adam and Eve and the rivalry of Cain and Abel, this sprawling saga has captivated audiences everywhere for generations. It is through the popularization of East of Eden that the Salinas Valley was truly transformed into \u201cthe valley of the world\u201d; a place where everyone is able to find a piece of themselves in the golden, rolling hills.\r\n([source][1])\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nContains:\r\n\r\n - [East of Eden 1/2][2]\r\n - [East of Eden 2/2][3]\r\n\r\n----------\r\nAlso contained in:\r\n\r\n - [East of Eden / The Wayward Bus][4]\r\n - [The Grapes of Wrath / The Moon is Down / Cannery Row / East of Eden / Of Mice and Men][5]\r\n - [Novels 1942-1952](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15334093W/Novels_1942-1952)\r\n - [Reader's Digest Condensed Books: Spring 1953 Selections](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15158232W)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.steinbeck.org/about-john/his-works/\r\n  [2]: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL17811975W/East_of_Eden_1_2\r\n  [3]: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL18023025W/East_of_Eden_2_2\r\n  [4]: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15138391W/East_of_Eden_The_Wayward_Bus\r\n  [5]: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL23165W/The_Grapes_of_Wrath_The_Moon_is_Down_Cannery_Row_East_of_Eden_Of_Mice_and_Men", "cover_url": "https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/11386937-L.jpg"}, {"title": "The Pearl", "author": "John Steinbeck", "olid": "OL7966242W", "description": "A novel.", "cover_url": "https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9292332-L.jpg"}, {"title": "Sense and Sensibility", "author": "Jane Austen", "olid": "OL66562W", "description": "When Mr. Dashwood dies, he must leave the bulk of his estate to the son by his first marriage, which leaves his second wife and three daughters (Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret) in straitened circumstances.
